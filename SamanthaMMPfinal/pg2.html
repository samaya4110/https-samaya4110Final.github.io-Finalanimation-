						<b> <h1> Accounting Assignments</h1> </b>

						<p> If I don't finish this assignment with anything higher than an 85, I am already at risk of struggling through the rest of the semester.  How am I going to finish all of this AND do laundry AND walk the dog AND get enough sleep for work tomorrow.  I really should cut some hours at work or switch shifts.
